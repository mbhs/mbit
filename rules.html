		<h2 class="subtitle is-4">Teams</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p><strong>Anyone</strong> is eligible to participate in the competition. Participants may compete in <strong>teams of up to four</strong> and are allowed to access reference books and the internet; however, they are encouraged to cite sources if they use code found online. Directly asking for assistance during the competion from anyone other than tournament organizers is not permitted.</p>
			<p>There are two divisions: <strong>standard and advanced.</strong> Standard division concepts include lists, loops, recursion, and algorithms such as BFS and binary search. Problems in the advanced division emphasize algorithmic complexity and efficiency, with concepts including pathfinding, dynamic programming, and segment trees.</p>
			<p>Generally speaking, standard division problems range from Bronze to Silver USACO levels, while the advanced division problems range from Silver to Platinum. Take a look at our <a href="/archive">archive</a> to get a sense of the difficulty of each division. The sample problems on the <a href="/">home page</a> can serve as additional guidance for which division to choose.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 class="subtitle is-4">Prizes</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Teams of students who have <strong>not yet graduated</strong> from high school will be eligible for prizes reserved for high school teams (in both divisions). In the advanced division, there will <strong>also</strong> be prizes for top teams that are not necessarily composed of high school students. All high school (and middle school) competitors should indicate the name of the school they attend and their grade during registration.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 class="subtitle is-5">Advanced division</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Top 3 high school teams (per member, subject to change):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>First place: $50 Amazon gift card</li>
				<li>Second place: $25 Amazon gift card</li>
				<li>Third place: $25 Amazon gift card</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Top 3 overall teams, excluding the top 3 high school (per member, subject to change):</p>

		<h2 class="subtitle is-5">Standard division</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Prizes (per member, subject to change):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Top high school team: $25 Amazon gift card, Wolfram|Alpha Pro subscription, exclusive mBIT T-shirt (US shipping only)</li>
				<li>Top middle school team: $10 Amazon gift card, Art of Problem Solving coupons, exclusive mBIT T-shirt (US shipping only)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h2 class="subtitle is-4">Grading</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Competitors will receive a number of problems and submit solutions in <strong>Python, Java, or C++</strong> to our online grader. Upon submission, teams will receive feedback on the accuracy of their program for ten preliminary test cases. These pretests are meant to give teams a general sense of the performance of their solution, without revealing the exact score. The results of the forty real test cases which are used for rankings will not be released to teams until the end of the competition.</p>
			<p>For each preliminary test case, teams will receive the input and output of their program, as well as any errors that occurred. There is no penalty for multiple attempts, and there is no limit on the number of submissions. Teams will receive one point for each test case they pass (<em>not</em> pretests), plus twenty points for each problem on which they pass all test cases. This means that teams may receive partial credit for suboptimal solutions. At the end of the contest, only the most recent submission to each problem will be graded. The time of the last submission will be used as a tiebreaker.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 class="subtitle is-4">Conduct</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>All students are expected to <strong>behave appropriately.</strong> This includes being respectful to others, following competition rules, and just using common sense. Violation of any of these rules is grounds for disqualification from the competition.</p>
