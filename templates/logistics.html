			<p>The main competition will be 4 hours long and will consist of a number of programming challenges that teams must work together to solve. For specifics on grading and scoring, read the <a href="/rules">competition rules</a> and check out our <a href="/mBITSampleProblems.pdf">sample problems</a>.</p>
			<p>The fun round will be half an hour packed with fun programming puzzles, including code golf, a competition in which participants solve problems with as little code as possible.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p><strong>Registration has closed.</strong> Please email us if there are any changes to existing teams. See you in November!</p>
			<p>Each team will need an adult sponsor. The sponsor should stay during the event and will be fed. Multiple teams can have the same sponsor (for example, a teacher may be the sponsor of all teams from a school). If the sponsor is not an MCPS employee, they will have to complete a 30-minute online training course. More information about this will be sent out later.</p>
			<p>We will also provide lunch, so let us know in the form about any dietary restrictions we may need to accommodate. T-shirts are available and will be free for now. If you have any questions, or if something has changed after filling out the registration form, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:mbit.organizers@gmail.com">mbit.organizers@gmail.com</a>. We hope to see you there!</p>
